# pdga_rating_scraper

A script to automate the retrieval of one or more disc golfers' player rating from the website of the Professional Disc Golf Association (www.pdga.com).

User must define players of interest with the "get_player_info" function.  At present, the player name/player numbers pairs are hard-coded into the script but other data entry methods should be straight-forward (ex. reading from a text file).

Sample output:
